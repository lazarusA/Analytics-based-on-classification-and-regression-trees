This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
flights
```

```{r}
daily <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest,day) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
daily
```
```{r}
ggplot(daily, aes(x = day, y = count, color = dest)) + geom_point()
```
```{r}
daily %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = count, color = dest)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  geom_text(data = daily %>% ungroup() %>%  sample_n(size = 40), 
            aes(label = dest), color = "black") +
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(1.5, "cm"),
  legend.key.width = unit(0.5,"cm"))
```
