This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Mouse Allergen and Asthma Cohort Study (MAACS)

“Are overweight individuals, as measured by body mass index (BMI), more susceptible than normal weight individuals to the harmful effects of PM2.5 on asthma symptoms?”

https://laqm.defra.gov.uk/public-health/pm25.html

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
maacs <- read.csv("bmi_pm25_no2_sim.csv")
str(maacs)
```
```{r}
maacs
```
NocturnalSymp, is the number of days in the past 2 weeks where the child experienced asthma symptoms (e.g. coughing, wheezing) while sleeping.
```{r}
head(maacs)
```
```{r}
g <- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))
summary(g)
```
```{r}
g <- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))
print(g)
```
Adding layers... 
```{r}
g <- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))
g + geom_point()
```

```{r}
g + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
g + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
Facets!!! Becayse our primary question involves comparing overweight individuals to normal weight individuals. 
```{r}
g + geom_point() + 
        geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
        facet_grid(. ~ bmicat) 
```
More options... 

```{r}
g + geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 4, alpha = 1/2)
```
```{r}
g + geom_point(aes(color = bmicat), size = 4, alpha = 1/2)
```

```{r}
g + geom_point(aes(color = bmicat)) + 
        labs(title = "MAACS Cohort") + 
        labs(x = expression("log " * PM[2.5]), y = "Nocturnal Symptoms")
```
```{r}
g + geom_point(aes(color = bmicat)) + theme_bw()
```
Extra. y-limits... 
```{r}
testdat <- data.frame(x = 1:100, y = rnorm(100))
testdat[50,2] <- 100  ## Outlier!
g <- ggplot(testdat, aes(x = x, y = y))
g + geom_line()
```
```{r}
g + geom_line() + ylim(-3, 3)
```
What this does is subset the data so that only observations between -3 and 3 are included, then plot the data.
```{r}
p <- g + geom_line() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-3, 3))
p
```
```{r}
p + annotate("text", x = c(45,55), y = c(2,2), label = c("here1", "here2"), 
             color = c("red", "blue"))
```
